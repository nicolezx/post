Intro: Late, on a mid-week evening, Nicolas Godin joined Charles Curtin and Anna Tonkin to discuss his new album Concrete and Glass. Godin, an architect by training, is better known as one half of French electronic duo Air. In the conversation that follows, he reflects upon his way of thinking about architecture, music and life.

When I was 18 years old, I couldn\u2019t find any positions with record companies, and studying architecture seemed like a natural pathway for me. Ever since - even from the beginning with Air - I feel like I'm recording more as an architect rather than a musician.<br>I don't consider myself a musician. My main goal is to create songs. The only reason I play music is because I have to know how to play to create the songs. I have learnt to play keyboard, and bass, and create melodies and chords, but the final idea was to produce this kind of object. The song is an object to me. I\u2019ve always understood music as three dimensional, never as notes on a score.

I think there are a lot of common elements. As a child, my dad would tell me that space is defined by two walls; you use architecture to cut and define space, and I think music is exactly the same. A note by itself is meaningless, but if you put two notes next to each other it creates a chord. It can be a happy chord, a sad chord, a stressful chord. The distance between two notes - you can play with it as you would walls.<br>Also I like to find links between materials (concrete, wood, glass, bricks, marble) and sounds. I sculpt sounds, using synthesisers to create them from scratch. Sound is a malleable material. The physicality of music is very important to me. I could never use an instrument that has original presets. I need to create a sound from a wave - the same way a sculptor creates shapes from stone.<\/p>"},"id":"0e4dcb03-4b66-4080-84f8-919ab7236897","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"ba437fbb-372f-44e3-b5c8-d9717fb5575a","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"b7d086ba-8045-439e-9901-f6e05b0643eb"},{"attrs":{"type":""},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["NICOLAS-GODIN-C-2019-CAMILLE-VIVIER-3844-35a.jpeg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Photo: Camille Vivier","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"6feedf6a-6ff0-4cae-bac6-02092a2c3dc3","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"25742def-d247-4894-b06e-d15d7c9bb092","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"a2d978e1-63d7-4edd-86d4-12273a652fb9"},{"attrs":{"type":"interview_q"},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"<p>AT) The latest album, Concrete and Glass, draws its inspiration from a collection of modernist houses.

When my friend (artist) Xavier Veilhan had his exhibition Architectones I was with him and performed an accompanying soundtrack. These houses have a lot of information; the location, the materials, the landscape, the era, the country and culture, its significance in human history. I try to draw from all of this as inspiration from my music.<br>You can make a soundtrack for anything in the world; for a painting, for a street you see in Paris, an object, a person - anything can serve as inspiration. And so, these houses with all this information created the music itself. I didn\u2019t have to work a lot because the message was already in the house.<br>Each song involves a different creative process. The last track of the album, Cit\u00e9 Radieuse, is just Le Corbusier\u2019s principle of modules transposed, and I did the same with small musical phrases that I have lumped together. This was a pure transposition of an architectural principle to a musical principle.<br>In contrast, when I looked at Mies van der Rohe\u2019s German Pavilion in Barcelona, for me it was the tone of a new era in human history and I wanted to express that idea. I could have music for the house, there is enough content - it\u2019s hard, very open, and you never know what's inside and what\u2019s outside. But I was more interested in what it represented to me, so basically I also could have made the music for a sunrise after the human apocalypse of a nuclear war. The song is more an extrapolation of the idea of something new in history. <br>More than writing about the house, it gives me an idea and I let my imagination work. I close my eyes, try to meditate, and suddenly you have all these things and ideas that originate from the house in your mind. Eventually you forget the house and find inspiration from other unknown sources. You end up going in a different direction. The origin is important, but once you start, the music takes over and you let it lead you astray. Then you have a song. That\u2019s why you can listen to the album without knowing anything about the original concept and just treat it like a normal pop song - I don't want to do conceptual, intellectual art. I want to make something more sensual.<\/p>"},"id":"08dc9c12-fb82-4971-8bb5-9cd08c772ccc","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"474aec82-72a5-4859-a993-bfa26df78f6f","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"36c34c63-4b6c-4b9d-8060-95200b371bf7"},{"attrs":{"type":"interview_q"},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"<p>(AT) The album was originally inspired by a series of live performances in these houses.

There were some songs that were performed live, and because of the reverb in the concrete I could only use one instrument. Basically, in terms of acoustics, it is very difficult to perform and record in these houses. Most of them are open on one side, so the sound was like air. There were a couple of buildings such as the projects by Claude Parent which are mostly concrete and resemble bunkers. They had about 10 seconds of reverb. It\u2019s difficult, but I also think it makes really interesting and unique sounds.<br>At the beginning of the Architectones project, I never thought of making a record. It was just a way to have fun, to travel, to meet architects, to see some amazing artists. But when I was in Los Angeles, in John Lautner\u2019s house, I didn\u2019t want to go back home\u2026 In Paris we have very few houses - there are mainly old buildings - and there\u2019s this freedom that you have in California, or in Australia, with the space and the sun. You can create a phantasm of architecture; in Paris it\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s no more space in Paris. All the architecture has been finished.

The John Lautner house, and also Richard Neutra\u2019s VDL House in Silver Lake remind me of Robert Altman movies from the early 70\u2019s. I grew up watching TV a lot and these soundtracks have had a big influence on me. These two houses, and the fact that they are in Los Angeles and feature in so many movies, meant the music came easily because it was a fantasy. The art was just the element of a bigger picture; an element of this gigantic city with its film industry and all these great movies and TV shows that I grew up with. My musical expression feels more like soundtracks. I never bought a record until the age of 14, and before 14 my only musical experience was through movies and TV. So when I created a band, I did soundtracks, because this is what I learnt from. These houses were excuses to let these influences open to me again.<\/p>"},"id":"52895f63-7e42-4754-9822-3acc67dd828c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"babc912b-a1f4-4a8a-a21a-8d2d2342c3ca","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"8f8cac93-990a-41d8-86a8-d103122269c8"},{"attrs":{"type":""},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["ads4177.jpeg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Photo: Roya Richmond","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"3cf6a164-8f3f-4649-82a0-9d6cb26b7d5f","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"018c5492-620b-419e-ad7f-59a92fe5837a","width":"6\/12"},{"blocks":[],"id":"6211ebc2-58bb-4590-a2a8-d58630192687","width":"1\/12"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["img_2804.jpeg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Photo: Anna Tonkin","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"5df8776f-0f5e-489c-9e72-7f233d945dc0","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"0d315af3-e639-40f7-9aa2-8bac8c0cb6a2","width":"5\/12"}],"id":"1b5a674a-7605-42f2-b079-498e62127922"},{"attrs":{"type":"interview_q"},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"<p>(AT) What fascinates you about modernist architecture?<\/p>"},"id":"8f3d49c5-2ae4-4d1a-bf46-627d10c10369","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"98e5b8e7-9e39-4974-a220-0e6eae20c099","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"ce0fc7be-1558-447b-82dd-9e0d4164cb0e"},{"attrs":{"type":"interview_a"},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"<p>(NG) I think it is the idea of creating your own future.

I want the music to be pure without any context. If you\u2019re interested in it you can find out it\u2019s inspired by houses. What I like most about music is that it is an art that speaks to your heart directly - you don't need someone to explain the theory. People have no fear if they don't like a song, or if they do. But sometimes when you see contemporary art, we are scared to give opinions. The same way with wine\u2026 I like that music isn\u2019t like that. Everyone feels comfortable to say a song is great, or it\u2019s not cool, or I don't like it, or this song makes me feel good or not. So I really wanted the album to be like that for most of the people that listen to it. You can decide if you like it without knowing anything about the inspiration or the architecture. Otherwise I would have released the song tracks of the exhibits as they were - I have the tapes at home and I could have put them on the album directly but I really wanted to transform the music into independent songs.<\/p>"},"id":"bbe32c66-6152-497a-aecf-87ab36a5649a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"b62040a8-66ab-45b9-b390-2ac65b785fc4","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"f48fe1d7-1386-4975-a503-8c2297d654f1"},{"attrs":{"type":""},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["nicolas-godin-c-2019-camille-vivier-3841-15a.jpeg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Photo: Camille Vivier","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"7676feeb-d445-4cd6-99a3-742e2bd83306","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"ef55564e-de3d-440d-8221-2a9106356bae","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"deffbbc8-d80b-4e18-a302-9a9fd51d31f1"}]
