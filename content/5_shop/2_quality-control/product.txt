Description-long:

Quality, Control examines the relationship between bureaucratic architectural practice and quality in architectural design and construction through the work of the Government Architects Office New South Wales. Conceived at the UTS School of Architecture, the publication repackages the catalogue from the exhibition held at UTS Tower in November 2019.

Quality, Control is a curated set of reproduced drawings, physical models, constructed mockups, commissioned photographs and commentaries. The publication also includes texts by Professor Charles Rice, Urtzi Grau and Guillermo Fernández-Abascal, Jack Cooper and Luka Enström-Gibb. These documents are used to reanimate archival records and bring awareness to an at risk portfolio of public architecture; an architecture built by public architects for the public.
